# Task 2: Multithreaded File Compression Tool

## Description
This project demonstrates multithreading in C++ by simulating file compression and decompression operations.

## Features
- Uses `std::thread` to run compression and decompression in parallel
- Simulates delay to represent processing
- Reads `data.txt`, creates `data.cmp`, and restores `data_restored.txt`

## How to Run
1. Ensure `data.txt` exists with some content.
2. Open the code in Code::Blocks (enable C++11 standard).
3. Compile and run.

## Output Example
compression done 
decompression done
